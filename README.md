# DataRepository

## Goals
One of the goals is to automatically see what we have in the data archive 
1) I would like to include WCS into every image so it doesnt need to be put into astrometry.net again.
2) I want to read the "in the image" from astrometry.net and rename files that may not be named correctly and include that information inside of the fits header.
3) Create a script to edit file names to follow a strict format to make it easier to search for objects within the data archive. This is defined (somewhere)
4) Eventually I want to flag data by quality and seeing as a way to easily know what data is great good and terrible. It may be we will look at a lot of things by eye but if we can do some of this easily we can then have campers even flagging data as to what is good or not.
